This is the base code for a python/streamlit online app to simulate the gravitational response of a 2D polygonal body. It uses Tewari's method for polygons, and can output the simulated data as a csv for further plotting in excel (for example... *shudders*). Full credits to fatiando.org for inspiration and approaches to potential field modelling. 

The running app is available at https://share.streamlit.io/thecraigoneill/gravitymodel/main
